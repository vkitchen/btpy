Introduction:

btpy is a python module designed to allow easier development of client software for btpd. btpd is a deamon that allows for sharing and downloading files over the bittorrent protocol.

Usage:

btpd needs to be started before btpy tries to send any commands. The Client object in btpy accepts one argument which specifies a new $BTPD_HOME where all torrent information is stored (default $HOME/.btpd)

Help:

btpy.py includes the majority of usage documentation needed. It is also one of the easier places to find information on the socket protocal however it's not complete.
